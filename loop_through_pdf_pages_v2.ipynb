They just \\nstarted the program this semester and will graduate from our Master’s program \\nin December 2023. We hope you will consider them for possible summer \\ninternship positions at your firm. \\nWe believe our students are the most astute, most capable, and best trained \\ngroup of students of any program. The resumes you find in the resume book \\ndescribe their distinguished backgrounds. For the past years we have one of \\nthe highest placement records for summer internships and full-time positions \\nof any program. Our students enter into front office roles such as trading, \\nportfolio or risk management, on the buy and the sell side. Their computing, \\nquantitative finance, and machine learning skills, as well as their hands-on \\npractical experience, makes them productive from day one. \\nOur curriculum is dynamic and challenging. For example, the first semester \\ninvestment course does not end with CAPM and APT, but is a serious data-\\ndriven course that, for example, examines the statistical principles and practical \\npitfalls of covariance matrix estimation and portfolio construction. As part of \\nour core curriculum, students learn the modern tools of machine learning and \\ndata science as they are used in the financial industry today. Our advanced \\nelectives cover cutting-edge topics in pricing, algorithmic trading, portfolio \\nmanagement and financial machine learning. Our instructors are high-level \\nindustry professionals and faculty from the Courant Institute, the top ranked \\ndepartment worldwide in applied mathematics.
